description: Everybody wants to pray with power-but how' Find out in the classic volume
  Quiet Talks on Prayer, now updated and abridged for ease of reading. This early
  twentieth-century guide by S.D. Gordon explains the meaning and mission of prayer,
  hindrances to prayer, the "how to's" of praying, and Jesus' habits of prayer. Identifying
  prayer as the world's greatest "outlet of power," Gordon encourages a vibrant, two-way
  communication with the God who longs for communion with His people.
